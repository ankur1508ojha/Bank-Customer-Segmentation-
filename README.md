# Bank-Customer-Segmentation-

The objective of this project is to train an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to perform bank customer segmentation, which can be applied in marketing departments in the banking and retail industries to segment customers into 'clusters' or 'groups'.Used Python libraries to import, visualize, and explore datasets,and understand the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithms, and learn how to apply these techniques to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization. Additionally,Used elbow method to obtain otimal number of clusters and used Scikit-Learn library to apply K-means clustering for customer segmentation.

# Segments of Customers 

New Customers : New customers with low tenure who can be targeted to enroll in other bank services

Revolvers: Customers who use their credit card  as a loan  , this group is the most lucrative for the bank since they 
pay 20% interest.
